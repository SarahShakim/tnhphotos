This website was created to advertise a photography business. I integrated Javascript with HTML and CSS to create a website that is appealing to the user and so it isn't static. It changes width depending on the screen size and has many dynamic features in place to improve usability.
On index.html page:
  - services section that has a description of the servies and when it's hovered over, will show the price
  - small portfolio section sampling some of the pictures she wanted to feature
  - about you section to talk about the business and the face behind it
  - useful links at the bottom of the page to ease navigation
Also included a system using PHP and MySQL:
  - the admin uploads an image or a folder of images with a password
  - the customer is able to access these images by putting in the designated password
  - ensures that each customer gets their respective pictures
  - automatically allows to be downloaded on computer so it can be viewed easily
  - password and associated images are put into a MySQL databased to be stored
